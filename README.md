[![Site Flex](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/monip.org.svg)](https://th3uss.github.io/Utilizando-flex/)

This is a website project built with HTML and CSS! It was developed during a [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) course with the purpose of practicing the concepts of `display: flex`.

> The site was created purely for the purpose of studying and applying flexbox concepts, not with the intention of being fully functional.
